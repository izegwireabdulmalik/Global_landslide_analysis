Global Landslide Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analytical review of historical landslide events conducted for the Global Geological Institute. The analysis aims to understand correlations between geography, population, and environmental triggers with landslide occurrence and severity globally.

Objectives

- Analyze global landslide patterns and trends
- Identify high-risk geographical regions
- Understand trigger mechanisms and their impact
- Provide strategic insights for preventive planning and early warning systems
- Create an interactive dashboard for stakeholder decision-making

Dataset Information

The dataset contains thousands of landslide reports from around the world, including:

- *Total Events*: 11,000+ landslide incidents
- *Total Fatalities*: 31,000+ casualties
- *Total Injuries*: 4,000+ injured individuals
- *Total Casualties*: 35,000+ total casualties
- *Average Fatalities per Event*: 3 fatalities
- *Fatality Rate*: 89%

 Methodology

### Data Cleaning (Google Sheets)

 Key Insights

Geographic Patterns

1. *High-Risk Regions*: Asia-Pacific dominates landslide casualties
- India accounts for 22.7% of global fatalities
- China contributes 13.0% of total casualties
- Mountainous and monsoon-affected regions show highest vulnerability
1. *Regional Clustering*: Landslides concentrate in:
- Himalayan region (India, Nepal, Afghanistan)
- Southeast Asian archipelagos (Philippines, Indonesia)
- South American Andes (Colombia, Brazil)

Temporal Trends

1. *Increasing Frequency*: Landslide events show upward trend since 2000
1. *Seasonal Patterns*: Peak activity correlates with monsoon seasons
1. *Severity Fluctuations*: Annual casualties vary significantly, indicating event magnitude variability

Trigger Analysis

1. *Precipitation Dominance*: Rain-related triggers cause 60%+ of fatalities
1. *Continuous Rain*: Extended precipitation periods particularly dangerous
1. *Climate Events*: Tropical cyclones and storms significantly contribute to landslide severity

 Strategic Recommendations
1. Early Warning Systems

- *Priority Regions*: Focus on India, China, Afghanistan, Philippines
- *Trigger Monitoring*: Implement rainfall threshold monitoring systems
- *Seasonal Preparedness*: Enhanced monitoring during monsoon seasons

 2. Risk Mitigation Strategies

- *Infrastructure Planning*: Avoid construction in high-risk zones identified
- *Community Education*: Target awareness programs in vulnerable areas
- *Emergency Response*: Pre-position resources in landslide-prone regions

3. International Cooperation

- *Data Sharing*: Establish global landslide monitoring network
- *Technology Transfer*: Share early warning technologies with high-risk countries
- *Capacity Building*: Support training programs in vulnerable regions

 4. Climate Adaptation

- *Long-term Planning*: Account for increasing precipitation intensity
- *Infrastructure Resilience*: Design climate-resilient infrastructure
- *Land Use Planning*: Integrate landslide risk in urban planning
